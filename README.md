The documentation is currently in the source.

<p>List of topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreword</li>
<p>Even though there were a bunch of scripts online which downloaded threads from 4chan there was always something I didn't like in their usage so I decided to make my own.</p>
<li>Synopsis</li>
<p>When in the directory of the script call: perl [url to 4chan thread] [args] </p>
<li>Dependancies</li>
<p>In order to run the script, you need to have the following modules installed:
Try::Tiny<br/>
LWP::Simple (usually shipps with LWP)<br/>
HTML::TreeBuilder<br/>
</p>
<li>Usage</li>
<li>To-do/Limitations/Bugs</li>
<p>Currently therer are several things I don't like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The thread monitoring isn't implemented in the script, so if you want to use it you need to write it yourself</li>
        <li>A single threrad is downloaded per script instance</li>
    </ul>
<li>Contribution</li>
<p>Feel free to use the code in any way you see fit</p>
</ul>
